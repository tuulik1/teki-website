    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: January 9, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile app, <strong>Teki</strong> (“App”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms and they will automatically apply to you. Therefore, you should read them carefully before using the app.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>You are not allowed to copy, reverse engineer, or modify any part of the App or the Teki brand in any way. Attempting to extract the source code of the App or make translated versions of the App in other languages is also forbidden. The App and all of its copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it belong to Teki.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Teki is a productivity tool designed to help you gamify your tasks and routines via the use of rewards ‘claimable’ with ‘coins’.</p>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Important:</strong> These coins are strictly imaginary and do not entitle you, as a user of the App, to any kind of real purchase or conversion to real life currency. Any use of these coins to signify real-life value is strictly the responsibility of the user.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and User Privacy</h2>

    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Accounts:</strong> The App does not require you to create or log in to an account. Consequently, we do not collect your name, email address, phone number or other standard personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>AsyncStorage:</strong> The App is designed to be “local-first”. All information you input within the app – including tasks, rewards, and their types – are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Because your data is stored locally, we do not have access to it. If you delete the App, clear your device cache, encounter a malfunction, or lose your device, your data cannot be recovered by us. We recommend manual backups if your device supports it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>While we do not store your data on our own servers, we use trusted third-party services which collect and handle some of their own data types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AdMob (Google):</strong> Displays interstitial ads. These may be personalized or non-personalized based on your device settings and location.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Provides us with crash reports to improve app stability. This data is anonymized and technical in nature.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage paid subscriptions (‘Teki Ad-Free’). RevenueCat tracks subscription status using an anonymous identifier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>We offer users the option to purchase a paid ‘Teki Ad-Free’ subscription.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> All payments are processed through the Google Play Store via RevenueCat.</li>
        <li><strong>Management:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your Google Play Account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund requests are handled according to Google Play Store’s refund policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer or disrupt the App’s functionality.</li>
        <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
        <li>Manipulate the reward system through technical exploits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available." Teki is not responsible for any data loss, emotional harm, or productivity issues resulting from App crashes, bugs, or the deletion of the App from your device.</p>

    <p>The App uses an internet connection to show ads (Google Admob), send bug and crash data (Firebase Crashlytics), and manage paid subscriptions (RevenueCat). This may incur costs through Wi-Fi, mobile data, and roaming use. Teki will not take responsibility for any costs related to internet use nor the malfunctioning of the services of its third-party providers.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. We encourage you to check this page periodically for updates.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Estonia</strong> and the <strong>European Union</strong>.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions regarding these Terms, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@tekiapp.com">support@tekiapp.com</a>.</p>
